1. The search function doesn't make use of the posting list nor the skip pointer, instead the DOCs are stored in a string list and compared one by one. Although the skip pointers are intialized, they're never used.
2. Add more boolean operators, if possible. Currently it's AND by deafult.
3. Any other changes that you think will simplify the code :)

Happy Coding.
